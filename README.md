# Problem 3: Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Problem 4: Count Say

# Problem 6: Generate Paranthesis
Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

# Problem 7: Happy Number
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

# Problem 10: Number Complement
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
