#Problem 1: 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
     
#Problem 2: 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
     
#Problem 3: 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
     
#Problem 4: 
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n)).

#Problem 5: 
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

#Problem 6: 
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

#Problem 7:
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

#Problem 8: 
String to Integer (atoi)

#Problem 9: 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

#Problem 10: 
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
     
#Problem 11: 
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
