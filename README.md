#Problem 1: 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
     
#Problem 2: 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
     
#Problem 3: 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
     
#Problem 4: 
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n)).

#Problem 5: 
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

#Problem 6: 
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

#Problem 7:
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

#Problem 8: 
String to Integer (atoi)

#Problem 9: 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

#Problem 10: 
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
     
#Problem 11: 
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

#Problem 12: 
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

#Problem 13: 
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

#Problem 14: 
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

#Problem 15: 
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

#Problem 16: 
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

#Problem 17:
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

#Problem 18:
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

#Problem 19:
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

#Problem 20:
Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

#Problem 21:
Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

#Problem 22:
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

#Problem 23:
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

#Problem 24:
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
